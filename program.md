# Autoresearch: [YOUR SCIENTIFIC QUESTION] — HDR

**Local**: `/path/to/your/project/`
**Venv**: `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`

---

## Core Principle

**The goal is DISCOVERY, not model-fitting.** A model is infrastructure. The novel result is what the model finds: new materials, new designs, new physical insights. If the HDR loop never gets past improving a regression score, it has failed.

Every project has two phases:
- **Phase A (Infrastructure, <30% of effort)**: Build predictor/simulator, validate on known cases
- **Phase B (Discovery, >70% of effort)**: Use the tool to explore the unknown

---

## Objective

### Option A: Dataset-Based
Maximise **[METRIC]** on [BENCHMARK] via HDR. Then USE the model for discovery (screen novel candidates, identify non-obvious patterns, propose untested materials/designs).

### Option B: Simulation-Based
Optimise **[OBJECTIVE]** by modifying **[DESIGN VARIABLES]** evaluated via **[SIMULATOR]**. The simulation must be realistic (all dominant physics, hardware constraints, validated against known results).

---

## Phase 0: Literature Review

**Do not skip. 100+ citations minimum.**

### Deliverables
1. `literature_review.md` — 7 themes, 2000+ words each
2. `papers.csv` — 100+ entries (3-5 textbooks, 5-10 reviews, 30-50 recent, 20-30 methods)
3. `feature_candidates.md` / `design_variables.md` — domain quantities → computable proxies
4. `research_queue.md` — 20+ hypotheses, each traced to a paper
5. `knowledge_base.md` — established results, what works, what doesn't

### Themes
1. Domain fundamentals (textbooks, governing equations)
2. Phenomena of interest (mechanisms, precursors, known relationships)
3. Candidate features / design variables (the bridge from theory to computation)
4. ML/optimisation for this problem (what's been tried, what gaps remain)
5. Objective function design / feature engineering techniques
6. Transfer / generalisation across conditions
7. Related problems (cross-domain insights)

### Quality Gate
- [ ] 100+ papers.csv entries with 3+ textbooks, 5+ reviews
- [ ] 15+ candidate features/variables with physics justification
- [ ] 20+ hypotheses in research_queue.md
- [ ] Can explain the domain physics without notes

## Phase 0.5: Baseline Audit

1. **Read all code** — find bugs, suboptimal defaults, unused features/design freedom
2. **Decompose the score** — where does improvement effort have highest ROI?
3. **Validate the validation** — does it predict real-world performance?
4. **Audit data/simulation fidelity** — enough data? Realistic physics? Sufficient resolution?
5. **Missing data audit** — what would help but isn't available? What proxies exist?
6. Record baseline in `results.tsv`

### Simulation Realism (Option B only)
Before optimising, verify: all dominant physics included, hardware constraints enforced, sufficient resolution, validated against published results, dissipation/noise modeled, constraint violations reported.

---

## Phase 1: Tournament

Compare 3-5 **fundamentally different** approaches (not hyperparameter variants) with ~5 experiments each on the same features/data. Record in `tournament_results.md`. Select 1-2 winners for the HDR loop.

Re-run the tournament if the HDR loop plateaus (5+ consecutive reverts).

---

## Phase 2: The HDR Loop

```
1. Pick Question        ← highest-impact OPEN from research_queue.md
2. State Prior          ← probability (0-100%) BEFORE testing
3. Articulate Mechanism ← WHY would this work? Causal story.
4. Implement ONE Change ← git commit BEFORE running
5. Evaluate             ← run on ALL tasks
6. Record Results       ← append to results.tsv (no cherry-picking)
7. Update Beliefs       ← keep or revert
8. Update Knowledge     ← knowledge_base.md, research_queue.md, observations.md
```

### Experiment Priority
1. Fix bugs (highest ROI)
2. Domain-informed features / design parameterisations
3. Data utilisation / simulation fidelity
4. Training improvements
5. Architecture changes
6. Speed optimisation

### Principles
- **Domain-first**: every hypothesis grounded in domain science
- **Isolation**: one change per experiment
- **Bayesian**: state beliefs before data, update after
- **Cumulative**: every experiment produces knowledge, even failures
- **Plateau = explore**: 5+ reverts → new approach, not more tuning

## Novelty Checklist

Before declaring done:
- [ ] Results exceed published SOTA (or match with simpler/faster/more robust method)
- [ ] At least one surprising finding
- [ ] Knowledge base contains insights valuable to other researchers
- [ ] Could be written as a short paper

## Constraints

- ONE change per experiment
- ALWAYS test on small data before full runs
- ALWAYS commit before evaluation
- ALWAYS record in results.tsv
- ALWAYS use GPU if available
- Ground every hypothesis in domain science
- NEVER stop — keep iterating until the human stops you
